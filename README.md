# How hard is it to become an astronaut anyway?
A two-week project for the Lede program 2022 - an intensive data journalism course at Columbia's J School.

For project 3, I really wanted to focus on using visual elements to tell a story. I thought it would be really interesting to see just how hard it is to be chosen to be a NASA astronaut and use circles as a visual representation of the applicants and the elimination process throughout the application cycle. I started doing my research online and gathered the numbers and data necessary for this piece (see sources below).

There were plenty of pieces that inspired mine, but the two that most closely emulated what I was trying to make were The Pudding’s piece on Making it Big and NYTimes’ piece on the Deportation of Unauthorized Immigrants. 

In class, we had just learned the basics of Scrollama and D3, so I knew I wanted to incorporate those two libraries. Soma introduced me to PIXI.js, and helped me create the base code. There was A LOT of experimenting, hitting deadends, and pivoting in different directions, but I managed to add to the base code, stylize, and incorporate the PIXI elements into the scrollytelling format I was looking for. 

This piece is still very much in progress. In the future, I’d like to add a timeline to the scrolly element to show the reader which part and which month of the application cycle we are in. I’d also like to add some tooltips to the photos of the chosen candidates to give more of a background of who they are and what qualifications they have (both in progress!). 

All code can be found on GitHub.
