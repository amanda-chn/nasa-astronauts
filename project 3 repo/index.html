                Every four years, NASA chooses a select new group of astronauts to explore where few humans have ever explored, and discover the unknown. The newest class of NASA astronauts, Group 23, were chosen last fall and received a particularly high amount of buzz given the new Artemis Program that was announced back in May 2019. This program is dedicated sending humans back to the moon by 2024, and eventually onward to Mars. With these new sights in mind, the anticipation to join the Artemis class of astronauts was high… and the competition was brutal. 
               </p>
                <p class="m-4">
                 Applications to join the Artemis Generation was open from March 2-31, 2020 and during that period, NASA received over 12,000 applications from hopeful astronauts. This number was only second to the previous 2017’s cycle, where a record-breaking 18,300-plus applications were received. 2021’s candidate qualifications were more stringent than its previous cycle, which might explain the disparity between the two. Now, instead of a Bachelor’s degree, the education requirements have been raised to a Master’s or PhD, and the application period has also been shortened on top of that. The process to getting an offer to join NASA’s ranks is a long and arduous one. Over the course of 18 months, candidates are assessed, evaluated, and interviewed with careful eyes, that is, if they even make it that far.

                 Let’s take a look at the application process and see just how hard it really is to become one of the lucky chosen few.
